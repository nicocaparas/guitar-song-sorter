## ‚ú® Why I Built This

I created this very simple guitar song sorter because I wanted a personal tool to organize and sort my favorite guitar songs and tabs. I am a casual player who loves exploring new songs and previously, all the songs I was learning or knew how to play were listed in a Google Doc. This made tracking and organizing songs quite difficult and I wanted a quicker way to find the song I wanted to play along with the tabs for that song. I was also tired of not knowing what song to play when my friends would ask me to play a song, so with this guitar sorter I can just show them the list and they can pick out a song. Ultimately, this project helped me practice my web development skills ‚Äî especially working with localStorage, sorting/filtering logic, and deploying to GitHub Pages.

## üîß Future Improvements

The interface is very plain right now as you can see so here are some future improvements I am thinking of doing once my fingers hurt from playing too much guitar:

- **Improve front-end design and UI:**  
  Redesign the interface with better visual styling, modern layouts, and responsive design. 

- **Personal notes per song:**  
  Let users add practice notes, chord reminders, or tuning details for each entry.

- **Favorite/starred songs:**  
  Add a way to mark certain songs as favorites for quick access.

- **Search or filter by artist:**  
  Provide a search bar to quickly narrow down songs by title or artist name.

- **Add a safe migration system for localStorage data:**  
  Implement a migration checker to ensure that if the app‚Äôs data model or storage format changes, old user data can be safely updated without losing songs or causing errors.
